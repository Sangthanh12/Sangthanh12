# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Sang!

I am currently a final-year student majoring in Software Engineering. Throughout my studies, I have been exposed to various subjects related to software development, but I have a particular passion for web development.

I have worked on several personal projects, including an e-commerce website, which allowed me to gain hands-on experience with technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and database management. Now, I am seeking an internship opportunity to further develop my skills, gain practical experience, and contribute to your company's projects.
